# Alternative Recipes

This folder contains a working example of an alternative recipe. Alternative recipes are generally used to add aditional recipes to an existing gameplay item. Some example uses include adding a more efficent recipe to a higher level table and adding an item that can be crafting with multiple types of inputs. Real world examples of this already inside eco include Mining tools and Butchery recipes.

This example cleanly documents each part of the RecipeFamily alternative recipe definition and adds the Exotic Salad recipe to the Campfire for a slightly higher cost to demonstrate. 

Because this is not a compiled mod the C# class file must be placed inside the ``UserCode`` directory of your server's mod folder to enable. Placing it else where may result in the file being overwritten on server update or not being recognized.
