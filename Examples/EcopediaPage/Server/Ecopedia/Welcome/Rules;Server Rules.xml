  <!-- The banner section type allows for the addition of images that were previously created inside the client AssetBundle project. 
    These images will attempt to fill the full width of the Ecoepdia page so it is advised to use rectangle images that are longer then they are tall. -->
  <section type="banner" image="EcoLogoSampleImage" />

  <!-- In most cases your page content should be enclosed in the base section tag. This allows the page parser to properly lay out the content
    you give it -->
  <section>
1. Don't be an jerk.
2. Don't game the game, IE: Use waterwheels without a watersource.
3. All Structures must be supported, IE: no floating stockpile platforms.
3.1. Bridges can still float, but must have "support" columns for aesthetic purposes. 

We hope you enjoy your stay!
