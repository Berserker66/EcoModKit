# Eco REST API Extension Mod

This Mod extends the REST API of the Eco WebServer with a simple `Hello World!` Endpoint.
It will be accessible by default on `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/helloworld`.

## Use Cases

Sometimes, it can be useful to add additional endpoints, which are not available with the default Rest API:

- Fetch extended Informations about the Server from an external Service.
- Extend the Web Interface and add a backend for it (Price Calculators, Chat Mods, ..)

## Additional Documentation

This is just a basic ASP.NET MVC Controller.
For additional Informations, checkout [the Offical Documentation](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/mvc).
